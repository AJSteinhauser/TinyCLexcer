# Project 3 
   I give up... I've been trying to get this program for a very long time, easily spent 6+ hours just googling and trying to find
   resources and much more trying get the dang thing to work. I have never programmed in C (much less x86_64) until this project and 
   only this 3rd part had any substantial amount of C code. 

   Over the course of this final project I deleted everything and restarted it 3 times because of seemingly incurrable SEGFAULTS. The version 
   of the project only outputs headers and labels, any other attempts at code generation leads to SEGFAULTS and no output given so this 
   seemed like the best option.

   I knew going into this that I'd be aiming for partial credit but I'm sad about how small of a % I will be getting. Couldn't really get 
   very far into code generation because of all the problems I was having with not knowing the language I was programming in.

   To compile code
      make

   To execute program on hello world program
      make run 

   To execute on custom TinyC program (x86_64 code is directed to terminal output)
      ./bin/bison.out < [CUSTOM_INPUTFILE_.C]


# Project 2

   To compile bison code:
      make bison

   To execute bison parser on hello world program
      make runbison

   To execute parser on custom TinyC program
      ./bin/bison.out < [CUSTOM_INPUTFILE_.C]

Project 2 is a partner project by:
	AJ Steinhauser
	Sol Park


# Project 1
   To compile lexer code:
      make lex

   To execute lexer on hello world program
      make runlex

   To execute lexer on custom TinyC program
      ./bin/scanner.out <file.c>
